-figured out how to save my code and upload the code to github by using my ide (visual studio) <br />
-the reason why it wasn't updating my code was because i didn't save my code to my file which won't let the git to upload it to github <br />
-and the next thing i test was how long github take to update the website from the looks of it takes about 2-5 min to update the website <br />

- when doing switching computer you need to do a git pull to update the code or update a brench
- need more testing
- if there's an error in which it said everything is up to date and it isn't please use git commit -m initialcommit than do git push origin main to push through github
- git checkout -b "name" is how you make different brench so that you can mess around with, without affecting the other code / website
- git commit -m "name" will solve everything
- have made a link in which it can go to differnt part of my website
- by making a new html file and connecting it with a:link which will look like this
- a href="prevous link + new one">"name for the link"</ a
- you can do git switch to move around brench
- once you do that and do a git pull you can update your code from github
