-figured out how to save my code and upload the code to github by using my ide (visual studio) <br />
-the reason why it wasn't updating my code was because i didn't save my code to my file which won't let the git to upload it to github <br />
-and the next thing i test was how long github take to update the website from the looks of it takes about 2-5 min to update the website <br />
